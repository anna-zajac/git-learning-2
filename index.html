                As the seconds pass, <br>
                We look back <br>
                At what our lives have held.<br><br>

                As the minutes pass,<br>
                We see what fell through the cracks.<br>
                Parts of our lives we withheld.<br><br>

                As the hours pass,<br>
                We think of what we learned,<br>
                What we have taught,<br>
                What we have forgot.<br><br>

                As the days pass,<br>
                We wish a lot could be returned.<br>
                We wish we would have never fought<br>
                You hope they forget me not.<br><br>

                As years pass,<br>
                You stand alone.<br>
                They have all grown,<br>
                Married and gone<br>
                Or on their own.<br><br>

                As your life passes,<br>
                You stand proud,<br>
                Looking how well they raise their own.<br>
                You did well.<br>
                Live on...<br><br>
